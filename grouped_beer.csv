The resulting Schlenkerla Oak Smokemalt has a smoother and more multilayered smoky note than the intensely aromatic beech smokemalt. The hence complex smokiness in this double bock is paired with the multifaceted bitterness of finest Hallertau aroma hops. With 8% alcohol and amber color it matures for months in the 14th century brewery cellars into a special treat for smoke beer lovers.

Anchor Liberty Ale,Anchor Liberty Ale,1290,IPA - American,32,Anchor Brewing Company,"Notes:The champagne-like bubbles, distinctive hop bouquet, and balanced character of Liberty Ale® revives centuries-old ale brewing traditions that are now more relevant than ever.	First introduced in 1975, Liberty Ale® is brewed strictly according to traditional craft brewing methods, and uses only natural ingredients — pale malted barley, fresh whole-cone Cascade hops and a special top-fermenting yeast, and water.The yeast used during fermentation produces many of Liberty Ale's subtle flavors and characteristics. A natural process called ""bunging"" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.Liberty Ale® was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Revere’s historic ride. As the first modern American IPA brewed after prohibition and the first modern American single-hop ale and dry-hopped ale, Anchor’s Liberty Ale® is the original craft brewed ale and the historic beer that started a revolution.

Arctic Devil Barley Wine,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4260,Barleywine - English,98,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.,"Notes:Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.20 IBU	",13.2,4.38,10,72,69,28,123,23,0,49,23,24,141,385,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.,4.19377990430622,4.3875598086124405,4.119617224880383,4.3349282296650715,4.437799043062201,18093

Asahi Super Dry,Asahi Super Dry,3551,Lager - Japanese Rice,82,Asahi Breweries Ltd,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.

Beatification,Beatification,5513,Wild Ale,126,Russian River Brewing Company,"Notes:This beer is very unique and inspired by breweries in the Lambic region of Belgium and, especially, our friends at Cantillon. It is 100% spontaneously fermented, meaning yeast is not added. Once the beer is brewed, it is transferred to a cool-ship or “horny” tank located in our barrel room at the pub. There it sits overnight and collects whatever funky wild yeast and bacteria may be living in the room. The next day it is transferred to oak wine barrels where it ferments wildly and ages for a few months. The end result is a wild, spontaneously fermented, sour, and tasty hand-crafted beer!

Brinkley's Maibock,Brinkley's Maibock,144,Bock - Maibock,4,Free State Brewing Co.,"Notes:This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. ""The Goat Gland Doctor."" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals. Some farmers are even said to have brought along there own goats because they felt them to have superior sexual prowess.

Cellar Door,Cellar Door,1875,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,45,Stillwater Artisanal Ales,"Notes:Over the ages the term ’cellar door’ has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.

The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city.

Chocolate Ale,Chocolate Ale,4518,Strong Ale - American,103,Boulevard Brewing Co.,"Notes:One of the brightest stars in a city filled with culinary treasures, Christopher Elbow has been handcrafting masterpieces in chocolate for more than ten years. In that time the reputation of his artistic delicacies has spread around the globe. Elbow’s sweets are distinguished by their use of unusual and sometimes surprising flavors and ingredients; in that adventurous spirit we joined forces to bring you a very special Chocolate Ale.In developing this beer, Elbow and Boulevard brewmaster Steven Pauwels sought to harmonize the interplay of chocolate and malt, with each supporting and enhancing, but not overwhelming, the other. Just the right chocolate was essential. Elbow recommended a rare variety from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma, and a personal favorite. More than a mere flavoring, the chocolate — in the form of nibs, or crushed, roasted beans – was incorporated into the brewing process itself.24 IBU	",8.7,3.76,10,132,24,46,124,16,0,22,25,22,169,423,Boulevard Brewing Co.,3.85546875,3.98828125,3.91796875,3.89453125,4.01171875,66077

During the fermentation process generous amounts of foam and surface bubbles burst in the tank, giving the illusion that the ferment is boiling or “steaming.” Tony Russomanno and Noah Hopkins took it upon themselves to brew Dampf Loc as a modern interpretation of its Teutonic predecessor, creating a “Hefe Gerste” ale that is true to its roots; unmistakable in character yet accessible to beer drinkers of all palates.Dampf Loc has a mild hop profile, medium body with pleasant effervescence and a clear, rich, orange hue. Dampf Loc is ideal for warm months, yet enjoyable year round.

In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.

It is lightly spiced with Liberty hops, an American version of the noble German Hallertau Mittelfruh, and fermented with lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich. In the traditional manner, Double Vision is fermented cold (48 F) and lagered a full 10 weeks for smoothness. At over 8% alcohol by volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.

Firestone Lager,Firestone Lager,2525,Lager - Helles,59,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,"Notes:We created our first Firestone Lager in 2000, and it proved to be well ahead of its time. Now it's back, new and improved, for those who finally want a better lager.In a craft world dominated by hoppy beers, we have gone back to basics with Firestone Lager. this is our hardest beer to make--and our easiest one to drink. Made in the classic all-malt Munich Helles style, Firestone Lager demands technical perfection from our brewing team, with a transparent canvas that would otherwise reveal the smallest flaw. Gambrinus pilsner malt establishes a crisp, dry base with a soft mouthfeel, while noble German hops provide just a whisper of bitterness. The result is an impossibly smooth and immensely drinkable beer that aims to help redefine American Lager. In the words of Brewmaster Matt Brynildson, ""Firestone Lager is made for drinking, not thinking. It's all about enjoying a good, clean beer.""

It begins as Lost and Found ale and is sent into freshly emptied red wine barrels. The beer spends over a year in the wood during which time it is spiked with three additions of raspberries.The first sip produces a sweet start with a long drawn out sour finish. Some of the sweetness from the raspberries comes out before acidic notes join the mix. On the back end of the beer is a smoothing oak character which keeps the beer from becoming dull.	,7.0,4.36,49,28,7,2,115,154,3,110,11,9,30,18149,The Lost Abbey,4.188622754491018,4.341317365269461,3.937125748502994,4.1017964071856285,4.287425149700598,55992

Good Harbor Golden Ale,Good Harbor Golden Ale,1829,Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,44,Leelanau Brewing Company,"Notes:This Golden Ale is Inspired by Franco-Belgain bière de gardes, but not exactly fitting the profile of its European counterparts, this beer is best described as a Michigan Bière de Garde. Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.

Grande Dame Oud Bruin,Grande Dame Oud Bruin,5388,Sour - Flanders Oud Bruin,123,Brasserie Trois Dames,"Notes:A sour brown ale, brewed in the Flemish tradition, that rivals even the best Oud Bruins coming out of Belgium. Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish. Altogether a pretty unique yet very drinkable beer.

Heady Topper,Heady Topper,1551,IPA - New England,38,The Alchemist,"Notes:Heddy Topper is an American Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of American hops will creep up on you, and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in you mouth. So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the can.Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more. -- John Kimmich75 IBU	",8.0,4.76,16,42,18,91,40,55,0,76,117,2,30,27039,The Alchemist,4.6257995735607675,4.660980810234541,4.163113006396588,4.405117270788913,4.608742004264393,16814

Helldorado,Helldorado,4215,Barleywine - American,97,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,"Notes:Part of the adventure of aging beer in retired spirits barrels is the synergistic interaction of different malt flavors with the oak and spirit flavors from the barrel. Darker beers like stouts and darker barley wines have typically been the favored candidates for barrel-aging, due to their deeper caramel and roasted flavors. Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts. The bready, honeyed flavors of pale malts pull out rich wildflower honey, vanilla and coconut notes from the oak, creating an overall flavor evocative of bourbon-glazed graham crackers that stands as singularly unique in our Vintage lineup.

The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse.

La Luna Rossa,La Luna Rossa,5444,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,124,Birrificio Del Ducato,"Notes:I think that in the life of every brewer exists a particular moment that makes him proud and satisfied with his work: for me this time comes during the blend of La Luna Rossa. Maybe because it is the beer that it takes more time before leaving the brewery, or maybe for a certain analogy with the trade of enologist, it is always very emotional when myself and Luca (a solid presence at the brewery) find ourselves between sour splashes and leftover pieces of fruit that remind me the “visciole” (morello cherry) my grandfather used to eat while playng cards. It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries. Intense amber colour with ruby reflections, extraordinary aromatic complexity: fruity aromas (marasca and morello cherries in the first place), accompanied by subtle ethereal notes and sublime acetic hints and lactic acid, as well as shades of oxidized malts. In the mouth it is tasty, large, persistent, and ends with a magnificent and uplifting acidity.	",8.0,4.08,32,37,12,1,43,151,0,80,5,4,13,16043,Birrificio Del Ducato,3.5,3.5,3.3,3.7,3.8,73580

Little Red Cap,Little Red Cap,287,Altbier,8,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup.

Old Style,Old Style,2282,Lager - Adjunct,54,Pabst Brewing Company,"Notes:Originally called Golden Leaf Lager in the 1890’s, Old Style first appeared in local stores in 1902 and quickly became one of the region’s most widely enjoyed beers. It’s heritage and popularity are proudly displayed throughout Wisconsin and Illinois — one can’t go far without seeing a historically protected Old Style sign hanging on the side of a barn or in a tavern window.Old Style first crossed state lines into Illinois to capitalize nationwide bottlers strike and subsequent product rationing by the competition. It wasn’t long before Old Style became Chicago’s beer – served from the North Side to the South Side and everywhere in between. Being accepted as a true local, Old Style began sponsoring the Chicago Cubs in 1950. With Old Style still being served at Wrigley Field today, the partnership is one of longest standing in the country.In 2009, Old Style revived the centuries-old German brewing tradition called “Kraeusening.” This double fermentation process increases carbonation and richness, ultimately leading to a better tasting beer that has since been won medals at the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup.

Orval Trappist Ale,Orval Trappist Ale,2051,Pale Ale - Belgian,49,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,"Notes:Orval beer is a high fermentation beer. The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.

When coming up with the recipe for Pils owner/brewmaster, Rick, brewed 17 batches of this beer to make it perfect. The recipe is based on the traditional and beloved Pilsner Urquell, which is why we have chosen not to filter our beer and why our lagering time is as long as it is--from brewday to when we can or keg Pils it is at least eight weeks. Our Pilsner is a little more golden, rounder, and a little more malt driven than many other versions. The beer possesses strong hop character that is balanced by its rich, round, malty palate.

Rye-on-Rye,Rye-on-Rye,3704,Rye Beer,85,Boulevard Brewing Co.,"Notes:Why Rye? This assertively flavorful grain is more often associated with whiskey than with ales. Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.47 IBU	",12.0,4.25,11,52,102,18,71,14,1,19,11,28,161,423,Boulevard Brewing Co.,4.038167938931298,4.17175572519084,4.1679389312977095,4.1183206106870225,4.217557251908397,56168

Surely therefore, our Saison Dupont is considered as “the classic” among the Belgian season beers!Coppery blond, the finest aromas and a strong bitterness transform this beer into a thirst-quenchener with no equal, just the way it was created. Our selection of yeasts is the perfect base for these typical aromas and ditto taste.

Sanctification,Sanctification,5101,Brett Beer,117,Russian River Brewing Company,"Notes:Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.

Sunshine golden with a fluffy head and a veil of Belgian ale yeast, Singel’s tropical fruit esters complement its spicy hop aromatics. Delicate in body, Singel’s mellow, dry finish culminates a truly ethereal experience. Hardywood Singel's stylistic inspiration originates with the Trappist brewers of western Europe, who are often celebrated for their gloriously complex dubbels and tripels, and whose devotion to crafting heavenly libations is second to none. Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery.

Secondary fermentation in the bottle gives it a unique aroma due to the presence of yeast. St-Feuillien Triple has a very strong and exceptionally lingering taste thanks to its density and its long storage period. Whether served as a refreshing aperitif in summer or savoured during the winter months, the Triple is a connoisseur’s beer par excellence.

The Big Smoke,The Big Smoke,3161,Porter - Smoked,73,8 Wired Brewing Co.,"Notes:Now what is this? A smoked beer?? It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.40 IBU	",6.2,3.88,19,104,18,60,89,25,0,28,37,118,133,22618,8 Wired Brewing Co.,3.828125,4.0,4.0625,3.765625,3.78125,63898

The fruit is sourced from the region around Sint-Truiden in Limburg (Belgium).Unlike the most famous fruit beers the basic beer of the ""real cherry beer"" is not a Lambic but a West-Flemish red-brown ale aged in oak wood. About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer. This with the intention of becoming a more constant taste of the ""real cherry beer"" over the years.

Vichtenaar,Vichtenaar,5427,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,124,Brouwerij Verhaeghe,"Notes:The ""Vichtenaar"" is a beer that is brewed on the basis of deeply burned malt, spicy and fruity hops, yeast and soft water pumped from a well with a depth of 172 m, which is a guarantee of the quality and the purity of the water. After the main fermentation and the second lagering the ""Vichtenaar"" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The ""Vichtenaar"" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The ""Vichtenaar"" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur. In 1958 “Brewery Verhaeghe” obtained for its beer ""Vichtenaar"" the first prize in the international contest for beers in Ghent.

West Coast Wheat Wine,West Coast Wheat Wine,4787,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,504,Dubbel,14,Brouwerij Westmalle,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.

Zeppelin Bier,Zeppelin Bier,2618,Lager - Kellerbier / Zwickelbier,61,Brauerei Max Leibinger GmbH,"Notes:Our Zeppelin Beer is a so-called ""Kellerbier"". The name ""Kellerbier"" has historical roots, dating back to the time when beer was still served directly from the cellar. It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.

An ancient style from the Rhineland, Altbiers are ales that were virtually wiped out by German lagers in the 1800’s. We use plenty of European hops and German pilsner malts to brew a remarkably clean beer. We then rest it in the cooler for two months to achieve the mellow finish that is the Überalt’s trademark.
